### Overview

This repo corresponds to the Kaggle competition 
[Child Mind Institute â€” Problematic Internet Use](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/child-mind-institute-problematic-internet-use).

My first solution consisted on copying what most of the public solutions did: merging the non-temporal data with a .describe() of the time series data. This yielded a CV metric of 0.438 by filling the missing data with an XGBoost prediction.

In order to better use the time series data, I wrote all the data into TFRecords, and trained a Keras model with it.

TODO: describe how to run the shallow and deep solutions

### Install

Working:
- numpy=1.19.5
- tensorflow-gpu=2.2.0
- pandas=1.2.0

These could work:
- pyarrow=17.0.0
- fastparquet=0.4.1

### Fix

- pandas, pyarrow and fastparquet are not compatible
